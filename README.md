This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in COBOL related to the MOVE statement. The MOVE statement creates a copy of data instead of creating a reference to the source.  This can cause unexpected behavior if the source data is modified after the MOVE operation.  The repository contains the buggy code and a corrected version using a different approach.  Refer to the comments in the code for details and explanation.
